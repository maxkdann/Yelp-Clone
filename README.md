# Yelp-Clone
A simple React Native app to search restaurants in Waterloo using the Yelp API. To run the program make sure you have Node.JS installed on your system and then type the command "npm start" into the terminal in the same directory where the app is stored to start the Metro Bundler. Install the Expo Go app on your phone to run the app.
